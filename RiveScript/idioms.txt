a long story short
a piece of cake
at the end of the day
back to square one
barking up the wrong tree
beating around the bush
better late than never
break a leg
call it a day
cost an arm and a leg
cut to the chase
dead as a doornail
dog eat dog
don't cry over spilt milk
eat your heart out
get a life
get the ball rolling
give the benefit of the doubt
go the extra mile
have a ball
hit the nail on the head
in the nick of time
keep your chin up
kill two birds with one stone
let the cat out of the bag
make a long story short
make hay while the sun shines
on the ball
on the same page
put two and two together
saved by the bell
spill the beans
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
the ball is in your court
the best of both worlds
the early bird gets the worm
the whole nine yards
throw in the towel
under the weather
up in the air
when pigs fly
you can say that again
